# liri

This Liri app is a pseudo Siri app. The user will give liri one of 3 requests"
        "spotify-this-song"
        "movie-this"
        "do-what-it-says"
The liri app will then search a song and give information about it through spotify, it will search for a movie title and give you all information about the movie, or it will run a request through a separate .txt file that has a search and the query.
